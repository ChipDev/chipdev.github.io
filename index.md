> I've worked on many projects during the COVID-19 situation. A couple of them have had pieces of their code published on my profile [@stwt](https://github.com/ChipDev)
> It's an opportunity -- silver lining - that comes with being at home and having remote learning. 

>By staying at home, I've wanted to connect with nature more, and I think that being with nature and feeling the fog hitting you fast really inspires you.  

>Ironically, the idea of being in nature contrasts so much with sitting on a computer thinking logically and typing code, getting into 'the zone' and putting insane focus into projects. It sounds like a Silicon Valley thing. Working so hard on projects at home and always having the redwoods a couple miles away.

>A lot of my projects, on github or not, have dealt with these subjects:

 - IOT
 - Stocks
 - Physics
 - Windows applications
 - Electrical Engineering

> Really, its just these subjects tied together in a few projects. One of the hardest things to find during the lockdown (or just staying at home for longer periods of time) is motivation. That's why many of these projects are unfinished. You can work on any of these things and put hours and hours into it- and really enjoy it- but you can't get yourself to work on it again. New ideas come around or you're not  in the mood.

>I think that is where going into nature is the most important. Being able to see the ever changing, refreshing landscape, being able to actively interact with your environment, that's something that is super motivational and can inspire you to get back to whatever you were working on with a new mindset.

> Also being able to see the people who have the awesome homes built on the side of the hill. I gotta get to that level. That's a big part also :)

 
*Some pictures I took from the lockdown. Many from Mt. Tamalpais, good times with some close friends, cooking dinner under the redwoods at 11 PM, the fog coming over the hills, that's what motivates me.*

Hopefully we could all take something good away from this experience. It changed everyone's lives greatly, and some were able to adapt quicker than others. 

Some may have come out ahead, and I think that if you look for the opportunities in a situation, you can turn something into a positive experience.
